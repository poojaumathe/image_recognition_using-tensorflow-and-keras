Image Recognition (Classification): Image recognition refers to the task of inputting an image into
a neural network and having it output some kind of label for that image. The label that the network
outputs will correspond to a pre-defined class. There can be multiple classes that the image can be
labeled as, or just one. If there is a single class, the term “recognition” is often applied, whereas a
multi-class recognition task is often called “classification”.

A subset of image classification is object detection, where specific instances of objects are identified
as belonging to a certain class like animals, cars, or people.

Dataset Info: 

In this project, we will be using the famous CIFAR-10 dataset.

CIFAR-10 is a large image dataset containing over 60,000 images representing 10 different classes
of objects like cats, planes, and cars.

The images are full-color RGB, but they are fairly small, only 32 x 32. One great thing about the
CIFAR-10 dataset is that it comes prepackaged with Keras
